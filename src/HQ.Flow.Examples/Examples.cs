	/// <summary>
	///     Frequently you want to process batches of events as they come in rather than one at a time.
	///     This example demonstrates receiving a range of integers, but processing them in 10 batches of 1000.

	/// <summary>
	///     When you want your infrastructure to send events off-network, you need to serialize those events first.
	///     Often this responsibility is left to the producer itself, but you can use the built-in transport pipe
	///     to elevate the serialization responsibility and work with streams instead. Here, integers are
	///     serialized on one end, deserialized on the other, and neither the originating producer or final
	///     consumer knows about it.
	/// </summary>

				inbound); // Typically you'd put an enqueing consumer here to shuttle serialized events off-network

	/// <summary>
	///     In this example, events are pushed to disk by a consumer while they are being picked up by a producer on a
	///     background thread.
	///     If files matching the criteria already exist when the producer is started, they are picked up as well.
